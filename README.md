# Energy-Analytics-RAG
RAG app that answers quantitative energy questions using the Global Power Plant Database (GPPD). The system ingests GPPD into a knowledge base (vector + text), retrieves relevant passages, builds prompts, queries an LLM, and evaluates performance on a ground-truth QA set generated from GPPD. This is the final project for the DTC's LLM Zoomcamp
